I'm a student that does a bit of everything, none specially well. I'm from Chile (ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡±) and I'm currently studying engineering at the [Universidad CatÃ³lica de Chile](https://uc.cl/).

I program in C <img height="13" width="13" src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/simple-icons@v3/icons/C.svg" /> and Python <img height="13" width="13" src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/simple-icons@v3/icons/Python.svg" />, but I'm constantly learning and toying with new languages, currently Nim <img height="13" width="13" src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/simple-icons@v3/icons/Nim.svg" />. My main interest is biomedical engineering, but I'm also interested in Computer Science (go [CS50x](https://online-learning.harvard.edu/course/cs50-introduction-computer-science)!), [Quantified Self](https://github.com/woop/awesome-quantified-self) and Meta-Science, along with a bunch of other things. I'm a yearly organizer of [March for Science Chile](https://marchforscience.com/).

ðŸ’¬ Feel free to contact me if you're looking to collaborate on something!

My pronouns are *he/him*.
