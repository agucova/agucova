I'm a student that does a bit of everything, none specially well. I'm from Chile (🇨🇱) and I'm currently studying engineering at the [Universidad Católica de Chile](https://uc.cl/).

I program in C and Python 🐍, but I'm constantly learning and toying with new languages, currently Nim 👑. My main interest is biomedical engineering, but I'm also interested in Computer Science (go [CS50x](https://online-learning.harvard.edu/course/cs50-introduction-computer-science)!), [Quantified Self](https://github.com/woop/awesome-quantified-self) and Meta-Science, along with a bunch of other things. I'm a yearly organizer of [March for Science Chile](https://marchforscience.com/).

💬 Feel free to contact me if you're looking to collaborate on something!

My pronouns are *he/him*.
